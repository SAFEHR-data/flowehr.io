## Code to Bedside
FlowEHR is an open-source platform for iterative, safe & reproducible development & deployment of data science solutions inside the NHS.

FlowEHR enables multidisciplinary teams to work higher up the stack and focus on improving patient outcomes and health system efficiency.


## Join Us
Our ambition is to plant FlowEHRs across the NHS and weâ€™re eager to hear from Integrated Care Systems, trusts, Academic Health Science Networks or other NHS organisations who want to unlock the transformative power of their data.
